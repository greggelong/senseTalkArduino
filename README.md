# senseTalkArduino
a place to hold some arduino code to create a sensing and vocalizing art installation

using librarys

selfCreatedVoice  is recorded in Audiacity and turned into LPC with Blue Wizard.  see Talkie library

This is just a prototype for an institutional, sensing, speaking thing.  in this piece distance is a stand in for temperature (i have ordered a thermometer) .  It really senses the distance using ultrasound pulses from the eyeball looking things. The voice is the same one used by in the military, industry and toys in the 1980s, based on the Texas instruments chip. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments_LPC_Speech_Chips
these pieces can be put into an object to look finished. The speaker i am using is one used by teachers and tour guides and has a nice institutional look.  The phrase it speaks is put together from the limited vocabulary from the old chip.  you can take a look at the vocabulary here: https://github.com/ArminJo/Talkie/blob/master/src/Vocab_US_Large.h
I like the sensing and vocalization of this thing it is an evolutionary step up  the blind motion of the foam things.


A note to myself.  ths is not TTS  but functions more like a serise of mp3 files would. it does have retro charm but takes up way to much memory on an arduino!
